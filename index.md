![The EPL](/images/lab_pano_2019.png)

The EPL is a lab for rapidly prototyping electronics projects.
It is meant for students to be able to walk in with an idea and walk out with a fully functioning prototype.

The EPL is on the lower level of the **PSU Fourth Avenue Building** (FAB) at **1900 SW 4th Avenue** in room **FAB 84-20**.
<!--- Our phone number is **503-725-2879**.--->

# The EPL is now allowing strictly limited student workspace reservations! Students will be able to reserve a 2 hour slot to work in the EPL. Please keep in mind that if you make an in-person workstation reservation you will be **absolutely required to follow all of our safety rules, NO EXCEPTIONS**. You will get your temperature taken before entering, masks are required *at all times* (over the nose), social distancing, and no food or drink is allowed. 

# The workstation is limited to an isolated work space which includes the following equipment:

# - Oscilloscope
# - Function Generator
# - 3 Output Power Supply
# - Multimeter
# - Soldering Station
# - Hand Tools

# Students will also be able to order 3D prints, PCBs, and laser cuts; they can be picked up when a manager is on shift (see our calendar) or during a workstation reservation. Please email epl@pdx.edu for more information. 

# **If you would like to make an EPL reservation please view our [Appointment Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UUptTkpPelVKbmNrfGRlZmF1bHR8NjQ1ZGNlZDkxMTZiYTljODAxMzIxMWU2NDA5MGE0NjA).** You will see 2 hour slots between 12-1600 named 'EPL Student Workstation Reservation'. *The email you use to reserve this slot is the email we will contact for building access, rules, and information*, if your reservation does not appear on your calendar please email us at epl@pdx.edu for assistance. --->

**We also have a discord server for students to interact with our managers. You can ask questions about your projects, resources, Analog Discovery 2's, etc. Join us on discord [here](https://discord.gg/xjqhGRRNB6)

# Lab Kits
This [link](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/ece-lab-resources/) will lead you to the ECE lab resources page. That resource page can bring you to more information on what components are required for each [lab](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/ece-lab-resources/students/lab-kits), what components are in a [tool box](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/ece-lab-resources/students/tool-box), and other resources and useful guides for students. __[Checkout] here.__ 

# Lockers
Online locker rentals are temporarily on hold while we rework the rental system. If you need a locker immediately, visit the store in person or send us an email [epl@pdx.edu](mailto:epl@pdx.edu).
<!--- If you want to rent a locker for the term or for the year you can do so by by clicking on the checkout link above. But before you do so please check out the [Locker] spreadsheet to verify that the locker you want to rent is empty and not currently rented. --->

## Online Resources
We understand that many students will still need to do prototyping.

besides from the obvious ebay, Newegg, and Amazon.

# Using the Labs
1. View our [Lab Equipment](/doc/equip) and read the instructions on the equipment you want to use.
1. Check the [calendar] for office hours.
1. Come in during those hours and get trained by a manager on the equipment you want to use.
  - Be sure you've signed a liability waiver!
1. Once you're trained on a something, you can come in during any office hours and use that equipment.
1. Pay for parts, materials, and equipment time [online][checkout].
1. When you've been trained on ALL the equipment you're eligible to become a manager.
  - This gives you 24 hour card key access, although it does come with a lot of responsibility.
  - [Click here][Become a Manager] to get started.
