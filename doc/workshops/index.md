# Workshop Schedule

We're so glad you're interested in taking an EPL workshop! 

The EPL hosts _Workshop Weekend_ 3 times per year, during the Fall, Winter, and Spring terms. 
Our [standalone workshops][Eventbrite] are about 3 hours long. 
They're open to the public, and cover a variety of technology topics that help students succeed at PSU. 
That makes them a great fit for PSU students interested in technology, high school students preparing for college, and hobbyists.

To sign up, [visit our Eventbrite page][Eventbrite] and register for your workshop! 
Each workshop is capped between 10 to 25 participants in order to keep our teacher-to-student ratio low.
You can sign up for as many as you want, so sign up soon! 
All workshops will be hosted during the weekend.

Some workshops occur at the same time, but the schedules are designed to avoid that.
Many people take 3 or 4 workshops over the course of the weekend.

# Room Assignments
We use a variety of rooms in the Fourth Avenue Building (1900 SW 4th Ave) and the Engineering Building (1930 SW 4th Ave). 
Due to scheduling constraints, we don't always know where we'll be until a shortly before the workshops. 
Therefore, we'll make sure to post room assignments on the day of the event so you know where to go! 
Check [the Eventbrite page][Eventbrite] the day before the workshop.

If you have any questions, [please email us.][lidworks]
